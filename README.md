## Getting started

* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — watches the project with continuous rebuild
    * `npm run build` — builds minified project for production
